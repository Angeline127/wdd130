    <p>I'm Angeline, from Ghana, I love to sing, write, listen to music and read. I am a return missionary
         and i served mission in Yamouusoukro Cote D'ivoire Mission where i studied French. I have been member for a quite long time now.
        I am currently a teacher and an online student as well at BYU. The reason why i love BYU ia because, I understand whatever thing they teach me,
      it is less cost and I have time to go to work.</p>
    <p>I love watching tutorials videos on YouTube. I am happy to part of 
        this class and i cannot wait to learn more in Web Development.</p>
    <p>This is a picture of me at the MTC during language studies.</p>
